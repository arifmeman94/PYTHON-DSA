#Write a program which does the following

#Find the area of a square of side 14cm.
#Also, find the cost of painting the square if the paint costs is 7$ cm/sq.
#Initialize the following variables in your program and use them in the computation
#s to store the length of side the square
#area to store the area of the square
#cost to store the cost of painting
#Output area and cost to the console on separate lines.

s = 14
p = 7
area = s*s
cost = area*p
print(area)
print(cost)
