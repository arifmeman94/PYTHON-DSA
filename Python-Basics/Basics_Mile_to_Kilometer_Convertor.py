#Write a program which creates a Convertor that converts miles into kilometers.(1 Mile = 1.60 KM)

#Accept user input and store it in mile as integer
#Compute and output distance in kilometers - km to the console

mile = int(input("Enter value of miles: ")) # this will give msg on screen (ex: Enter value of miles: )
distance = mile*1.60
print(distance)
