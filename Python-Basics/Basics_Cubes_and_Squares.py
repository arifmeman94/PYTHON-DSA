#Write a program which does the following

#Declare an integer variable a
#Accept a user input and store it in the variable a
#Declare 2 variables square and cube - compute and store the square and cube of a in them
#Output square and cube to the console on separate lines as per the sample output below
#Note
#Square of an integer N = N \times N (ex: N*N)
#Cube of an integer N = N \times N \times N` (ex: N*N*N)

a = int(input())
square = a*a
cube = a*a*a
print("Square is:",square)
print("Cube is:", cube)
